CurriculAI is an AI-based educational tool that leverages the power of Langchain and OpenAI LLMs to transform user resources into accessible and engaging learning materials.

## Features

- **Vectorised Database**: CurriculAI tokenises and stores all relevant resources into a vectorised database, ensuring efficient information retrieval and content generation.

- **Customisable Prompts**: The tool can generate textbook-style content and shorter form notes based on the custom prompts provided by the user. 

- **Question and Flash Card Generation**: Besides content generation, CurriculAI also has the capability to generate multiple-choice questions and flashcards, offering a comprehensive learning experience.

## How it works

### Vectorised Database
CurriculAI starts by tokenising user resources and storing them into a vectorised database. This process allows for efficient access and manipulation of information, facilitating subsequent content generation.

### Customisable Prompts
Once the resources are in the database, users can utilise custom prompts to generate textbook-style content or shorter notes. This feature enhances the tool's flexibility and usability, catering to a wide range of educational needs.

### Question and Flash Card Generation
In addition to content generation, CurriculAI can generate multiple-choice questions and flashcards from the same resources. This allows for a more interactive and engaging learning process.

## Technologies Used

- **Langchain**: Langchain is used for tokenising resources and processing language data.
- **OpenAI LLMs**: The content and question generation aspects are powered by OpenAI's Language Model (LLM).

## Future Development
We have ambitious plans for CurriculAI, including enhancing the AI's understanding capabilities, broadening the range of content that can be generated, and refining the user interface for an even smoother user experience.

Join us in revolutionizing the way we create educational resources!
